This is a little project I decided to do, feel free to adapt it however you wish, please do not take it and say it is yours!!


General Notes:

Current Syntax:
v[variable_name] == 0 | 1 (operator) 1 | "hello"+"bob" - defining variables

c[variable_name] == 0 | "text" - defining constant

display["message"] - displays message

display[variable] - displays variable

display["{{variable}}"] - displays f-string

v[variable_name] == i["input text" | "text {{variable}}" | variable] - input

f[func_name(parameters (none,one or many) --> {statements})] - define function

r[func_name(parameters)] - call/run function

v[variable_name] == r[func_name(parameters)] - assign return of func to variable

!!whatever - comments


Limitations:

Functionality of constant variables not there yet.

Need to implement different types of variables (str,int,float)

Function parameters don't work just yet.


Yeah, still working on a bunch of things, bit slow just now due to activities.
